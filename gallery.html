        of the water lily paintings of 1905, Claude Monet used a square
        canvas, depicting the pond surface from edge to edge. The pale lilies
        chart their random course over the waters, clustering together into
        single rafts of leaves and blossoms and then spreading off in
        different directions at the whim of the moving water. Like the lilies,
        Monet's glance skimmed over the pond, and his observations revealed
        his discoveries about the nature of water in his 1906 painting Water
        Lilies."

Being very beautiful and intelligent young lady, Camilla was of poor origins and often earned money as a model for such masters as Renoir and Manet. She became Monet’s model and muse but was not accepted by Monet’s family because of her origin. Despite that, Monet married her in 1870. Their first son Jean, who is also there on the painting, was born earlier in 1867."

          data-description="In February 1882, Claude Monet went to Normandy to paint, one of many such expeditions that he made in the 1880s. This was also a retreat from personal and professional pressures. His wife, Camille, had died three years earlier, and Monet had entered into a domestic arrangement with Alice Hoschedé (whom he would marry in 1892, after her husband’s death). France was in the midst of a lengthy economic recession that affected Monet’s sales. In addition, the artist was unenthusiastic about the upcoming seventh Impressionist exhibition—divisions within the group had become pronounced by this time—and he delegated the responsibility for his contribution to his dealer, Paul Durand-Ruel."
